# Code Structure Evaluation Report

## Summary
**Total Score:** 22/30

## Overall Feedback
This is a small, well-focused repository implementing a simple calculator with unit tests. The project separates core logic (math.js) from the UI (script.js), includes tests and a README, and uses consistent, descriptive naming. For a small app the structure is reasonable. The main opportunities for improvement are: grouping files into conventional folders (e.g., src/, public/), improving modularity for browser/Node interoperability (clearer module export/import strategy), broadening test coverage, and tightening some UI/error-handling patterns.

## Detailed Evaluation

### code_organization
**Score:** 7/10

Strengths:
- Files are named clearly and reflect their purposes (math.js, script.js, index.html, README.md).
- Tests are placed under __tests__, following common conventions.
- The repository contains package.json and tests, making it clear this is a runnable project.

Areas for improvement:
- All files live at the project root. For even modest projects it’s clearer to use a small folder structure (e.g., src/ or lib/ for code, public/ for HTML/CSS/JS served to browsers). That aids scaling and clarity.
- There is no separation between source and distribution or demo assets (index.html present at root).
- If browser and Node environments are both targeted, providing a clear module entrypoint(s) and/or bundler config would help consumers.

Recommendations:
- Move application source into src/, place tests in __tests__/ (already present), and put demo HTML/CSS in a public/ folder.
- Add an explicit entry in package.json (e.g., "main": "src/math.js") so consumers know the intended module.

### code_quality
**Score:** 7/10

Strengths:
- The math.js function is documented and includes input validation — good defensive programming.
- There are unit tests (jest) validating the math logic, which improves maintainability and confidence.
- Code snippets appear readable and formatted consistently.

Areas for improvement:
- The repository mixes browser-side concerns and Node/test usage; the project partly accommodates this (comment in script.js) but would benefit from a clearer, consistent module system (ES modules vs CommonJS). That avoids ad-hoc compatibility comments.
- Error handling in the UI (script.js) is not visible in full, but small apps often show direct DOM manipulation to show errors — consider clearer separation of UI error presentation and logic errors.
- Comments are present where useful (math.js) but could be more consistent across files. Inline documentation for public API (exports) would help.
- No lint configuration or code style enforcement found (e.g., .eslintrc). Adding linting improves consistency.

Recommendations:
- Choose ES modules (or CommonJS) consistently and document export/import patterns in README.
- Add a linter and a formatting rule (Prettier + ESLint).
- Expand tests to cover UI behavior or edge cases of the math functions (if applicable).

### architecture
**Score:** 8/10

Strengths:
- Clear separation between computation (math.js) and presentation/interaction (script.js + index.html). This is an appropriate boundary for this app.
- Low coupling: the math module provides pure logic that can be tested independently (as evidenced by tests).
- Simple, consistent architectural approach is appropriate for the size and scope.

Areas for improvement:
- There is not much in the way of architectural patterns beyond separation of concerns — which is fine here — but if the app grows, consider introducing clearer module boundaries and dependency injection for the UI (to make it easier to test DOM interactions).
- No build or bundling strategy is indicated; adding a minimal build step or explicit module type in package.json would help support scaling to complex apps.

Recommendations:
- If you expect the project to grow, add a small architecture section to the README describing module responsibilities and build/run instructions.
- Consider using a module bundler or configuring type: "module" in package.json to clarify module semantics for the browser and Node.
